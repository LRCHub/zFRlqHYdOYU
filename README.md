[00:00.27] One, two, three
[00:07.77] 
[00:01.42] I've been running from the pain
[00:02.93] Trying not to feel the same
[00:04.32] But it's a shame that we're sinking
[00:07.71] See my confidence is shaking
[00:09.50] And my heart is feeling vacant
[00:10.91] So you try to fill it in
[00:22.91] 
[00:14.23] You say I can fix the broken in your heart
[00:16.97] You're worth saving, darling
[00:20.55] But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark
[00:23.32] I got faith in nothing
[00:34.32] 
[00:26.92] But love, pray for me
[00:30.88] I never had somebody
[00:32.39] So I don't know how to love
[00:35.11] Pray for me
[00:37.13] I know I need somebody
[00:38.77] So I can learn how to love
[00:51.77] 
[00:49.26] I know I
[00:53.26] 
[00:58.99] Hoo
[01:00.49] 
[01:02.02] How to love
[01:07.52] 
[01:05.68] I know it's been a while
[01:06.99] 'Cause my memory's on trial
[01:08.76] For the way I used to be
[01:11.93] My head is running miles
[01:13.33] Round in circles and I try
[01:14.85] To find the little light in me
[01:29.85] 
[01:18.27] You say I can fix the broken in your heart
[01:20.95] You're worth saving, darling
[01:24.59] But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark
[01:27.38] I got faith in nothing
[01:38.38] 
[01:30.93] But love, pray for me
[01:34.86] I never had somebody
[01:36.30] So I don't know how to love
[01:39.17] Pray for me
[01:41.18] I know I need somebody
[01:42.71] So I can learn how to love
[01:44.77] Hoo
[01:46.27] 
[01:58.80] I know I need somebody
[02:09.80] 
[02:06.05] I know I
[02:08.34] So I can learn how to love
[02:12.46] How to love
[02:15.67] I know I
[02:18.57] For me
[02:19.44] Ooh, love, love, love, how
[02:25.38] Hoo
[02:28.47] For me
[02:31.69] Hoo
[02:32.33] I know I need somebody
[02:33.63] So I can learn how to love
